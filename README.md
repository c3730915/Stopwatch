# Stopwatch

**This is a milestone of my coding about android**

It's just a stopwatch app, but I learnt how to use Github to commit and push, this is also the first project that you can run on your phone, I just started my learn of Android.

So I'm gonna introduce the structure of this project in a brief way

* app/src/main/java/com/hfad/stopwatch/StopwatchActivity.java

  Shows how to work by using java, the way that the stopwatch perform and the inside codes of this app

* app/src/main/res/layout/activity_stopwatch.xml

  shows the layout of it.
